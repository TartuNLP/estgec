# Tartu L2 learner's corpus

This is the parallel sentences subcorpus of University of Tartu L2 learner's corpus ([*Tartu Ülikooli õppijakeele korpus*]( http://www.keel.ut.ee/et/keelekogud )). The corpus consists of texts written by students learning Estonian on B1 and B2 level. The parallel sentences subcorpus has around 9000 text extracts (one or more sentences each) that have been annotated with possible correction(s) of the same sentence.  
This version includes the 8935 extracts (*mistakes*) where at least one correction was provided.  
  

Each *\<mistake\>* has one or more continuous sentences where the student made grammatical mistakses, as well as possible corrections and comments added by annotators.  
* 1 \<original\> tag - The language learner's original sentence with mistakes.  
* 1 or more \<correction\> tags - A grammatically correct alternatve to the sentence, as suggested by annotators. Since there might be multiple ways to correct the original sentence, some have 2 or even 3 alternative corrections.  
* 1 \<comment\> tag - For annotators' comments about the sentence.
